# Name: To be determined
This repository documents our final project for the university course “Tech Basics 2”, in which we worked with the Arduino Kit
throughout the semester. <br>
<br>
The objective of the final project was to choose a task that was appropriately challenging. One that would allow us to demonstrate 
the skills we had acquired, while still remaining feasible to complete within the given timeframe. <br>
<br>
For our project, we recreated the iconic “Alphabet Wall” from the Netflix series Stranger Things using our Arduino kit. In the series, 
the wall features a string of lights arranged alphabetically, allowing characters to communicate from a distance by illuminating 
specific letters. <br>

This repository includes all essential information about the project, such as: <br>
- A complete list of the materials used
- Step-by-step instructions for building and implementing the functional light wall
- The full source code
- A guide on how to design and decorate the wall to closely resemble the original prop,
  including a detailed list of required materials 
<br>
The documentation is intended to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of both the technical implementation and the creative 
design process behind our project.
