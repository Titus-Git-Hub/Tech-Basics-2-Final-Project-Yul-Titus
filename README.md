The objective of the final project was to choose a task that was appropriately challenging. One that would allow us to demonstrate 
the skills we had acquired, while still remaining feasible to complete within the given timeframe. <br>

For our project, we recreated the iconic “Alphabet Wall” from the Netflix series Stranger Things using our Arduino kit. In the series, 
the wall features a string of lights arranged alphabetically, allowing characters to communicate from a distance by illuminating 
specific letters. <br>

This repository includes all essential information about the project, such as: <br>
- A complete list of the [materials](Materials/list-of-materials.md) used
- [Step-by-step instruction](Instruction/step-by-step-instruction.md) for building and implementing the functional light wall
- The full source [code](Code/final_code.ino)
- A guide on how to [design and decorate](Decoration/TBD) the wall to closely resemble the original prop,
  including a detailed list of required materials
<br>
The documentation is intended to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of both the technical implementation and the creative 
design process behind our project.
