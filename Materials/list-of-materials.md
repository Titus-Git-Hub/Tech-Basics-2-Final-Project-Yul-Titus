# Full List of Materials

Below you can find a list of all materials used in our project. <br>

For the implementation, we were able to borrow two Arduino starter kits, which provided the majority of the required components. The kits are available on Amazon under the title:

<a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B07CXKP3R3/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=ADX1E4W4DEI4I&psc=1">>_**“Miuzei Starter Kit für Arduino R3 Projekte mit Mikrocontroller, LCD1602 Modul, Steckbrett, Servomotor, Sensoren, Tutorial MA13”**_<</a>

However, some additional components were necessary to complete our project:
* The starter kit only included one 74HC595 shift register each, while our setup required four. The additional two were kindly provided by our professor.
* The I2C module for the LCD display is not included in the starter kit. If you plan to replicate our project exactly with the display + joystick input system, you will need to purchase an I2C module separately.
* We also required a significantly higher number of male-to-female jumper wires, that are not included in two starter kits, as the LED wall setup demanded extensive wiring.

If you intend to rebuild the project in the same configuration, please make sure to account for these additional components. <br>
